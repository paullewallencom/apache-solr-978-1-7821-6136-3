#  Bootstrap configuration for Heritrix settings system.  If no values are 
#  specified, sensible defaults are used.  So, an empty file is a valid 
#  configuration.  However, the *existence* of this file is important; in the
#  absence of a sheets-dir parameter, the settings system will use this file's
#  path to find a subdirectory named "sheets" to get the rest of the settings.

#  This file is in java.util.Properties format.


#  The location of the sheets subdirectory.  There will be one text file per
#  sheet in this directory.  If unspecified, the value will be "sheets"
#  appended to the parent directory of this configuration file.
#sheets-dir=/tmp/sheets


#  The directory containing the BDB environment used by the settings system.

#  Whether or not to copy the bdb logs during a checkpoint.  This can greatly
#  slow down the checkpoint operation if the crawl is big.

#  The percentage of JVM RAM to use for the BDB database during a live crawl.  
#  Defaults to 60%.

#  The percentage of JVM RAM to use for the BDB database when loading an 
#  inactive crawl, such as a profile or completed job.  This is just 5% to 
#  allow an operator to view a profile or completed job while a live job is
#  still running.
