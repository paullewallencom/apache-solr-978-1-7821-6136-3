Quick guide to installing and running Distributor:

Install
-------

Presuming you want to install into /usr/local:

- cp distributor.conf /usr/local/etc/distributor.conf
- cp build/lib/distributor-x.x.jar /usr/local/lib/distributor-x.x.jar

- Edit distributor.conf, read README.distributor.conf for help
- Get Java 1.4.0 or greater.  Distributor uses many features that were
  introduced in Java 1.4.  http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html
  You can just get the JRE if all you want to do is run Distributor.  If
  you want the compiler, etc. get the SDK.

Resource limits
---------------

If you expect a large number of connections to your load balancer, you
might need to worry about increasing resource limits on your load
balancer.

Linux:
The number of file handles is limited to 4096 system-wide and 1024
per process by default.  See http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/#tuning
See the comments in the sample distributor.init for an example of
raising the per-process limit.

Solaris:
Solaris does not appear to have a system-wide limit, only a per-process
limit.  According to Sun[1], the hard limit is 256 for a 32-bit program
and 2 billion for a 64-bit program.  So you really want to make sure you
get the 64-bit version of the JVM (it's a seperate download that adds on
to the 32-bit version).  Even with a larger hard limit, the soft limit
still defaults to 256, so you need to raise that with ulimit before
starting Distributor.  See the comments in the sample distributor.init
for an example.

Run
---

If you've configured Distributor to listen on a privileged port (<1024)
then you'll need to run it as root.  Otherwise it can as any user.
distributor.init is a sample init script for starting Distributor at
boot time.

java -jar /usr/local/lib/distributor-x.x.jar /usr/local/etc/distributor.conf
