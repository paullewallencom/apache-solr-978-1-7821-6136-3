Distributor is a software load balancer. Like other load balancers, it
accepts connections and distributes them to an array of back end
servers. Some of Distributor's more unique or advanced features:

  * Integrated testing of back end servers
  * Optional termination of client connections to misfunctioning
    servers
  * Online control of load balancer configuration
  * Grouping of servers with rollover from group to group
  * Two connection distribution methods: round robin and hashed based
    on client IP address
